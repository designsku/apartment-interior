<h3 id="baby-hayes-legacy-humphrey-is-here">Baby Hayes Legacy Humphrey is here.</h3><p>I know they like to have at least 18 months between births but you are not too far off. THIS WAS MY SECOND C-SECTION scheduled 17 MONTHS apart. A friend of mine had her first two 17 months apart also planned and then a surprise one 14 months later. They should allow you a cs this time no quibble if that is what you want. The baby I just had was 4 months old when I learned I was pregnant with the next one-apparently I have a very timely body. Hi mamas i was wondering if anyone here has an 18 months gap between their children and had a c section the first time and was allowed to have a VBAC with their second baby.</p>

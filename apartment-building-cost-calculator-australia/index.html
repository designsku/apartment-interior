<p>To help you to receive an estimate on the replacement value of your home use the Building Calculator 1 its a prepopulated form using industry data collated by CoreLogic. As every new house construction is different weve built a calculator below to estimate total costs based on average square metre rates for different home types depending on the number of bedrooms bathrooms and other factors affecting costs such as quality level of fixtures and fittings. Property investors who place assets in the low-value pool are able to claim them at a rate of 1875 in the year of purchase regardless of how long the property has been owned and rented. For reasonable per-square-metre costs in Australia use BMTs construction cost table. Sydney Residential Architect Home Area Calculator.</p>

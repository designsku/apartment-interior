<p>Apartment house also called apartment block or block of flats building containing more than one dwelling unit most of which are designed for domestic use but sometimes including shops and other nonresidential features. Ranch-style houses appeared in the 1930s but their popularity boomed in the 1950s. A co-op or cooperative housing is a type of apartment where one buys in to become a part-owner of that entire piece of property. This means they can be used as tiny primary homes or more often than not as auxiliary units like a home office workshop or guest cottage that sits detached from the primary residence. 2 Storey Apartment Small Apartment Building Design Apartments Exterior Small Apartment Building.</p>

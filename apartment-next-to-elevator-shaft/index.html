<p>The bottom of elevator shafts can be frightening. For most home elevator designs a pit of 6 to 14 inches is also required below the lowest level and additional headroom extending into the attic may be required. Most home structures need little to no additional reinforcement to support an elevator apart from two vertical columns running top to bottom on one side of the shaft interior. Elevator shafts and staircase provide escape routes in case there is a fire so they are built to be very strong. Pin On Bfab Mood Board.</p>
